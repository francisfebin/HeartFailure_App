📌 Heart Failure Predictor 🫀🔍
Machine Learning Model Prototype by Febin Francis




📝 About
The Heart Failure Predictor is a machine learning-powered web app that predicts the likelihood of heart failure based on medical parameters. This is a prototype aimed at showcasing predictive modeling in healthcare. 🚑💡

💡 Disclaimer: This is for educational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice!

🌐 Live Demo
🚀 Try it out here: 👉 Heart Failure Predictor

🏗 Tech Stack
🐍 Python (Flask)
🌲 Random Forest Classifier (Current ML Model)
📊 Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Framework)
🎨 HTML, CSS (Frontend)
🌐 Render (Deployment)
🔮 Future Enhancements
🚀 To improve accuracy and robustness, I plan to experiment with:
✅ Logistic Regression (For baseline comparison)
✅ Neural Networks (Deep learning for better predictions)
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning (For model optimization)

Stay tuned for updates! ✨
